# airfoil-NACA-prediction
This repository contains the code for predicting the NACA 4-digit code of airfoil profiles from CFD simulation data. The pipeline includes feature extraction from flow fields, clustering-based region analysis, and supervised learning models to infer the geometric NACA code associated with each airfoil.
